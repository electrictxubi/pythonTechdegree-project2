I wrote this program with all the encypted and decrypted output in lower case. I like lower-case, and it didn't 
mention in the instructions that I had to use UPPERCASE. All input to be encrypted is stripped from
of spaces to make the optional one padding easier. The three ciphers I wrote account for the spaces. The menu system 
is different from the video but all the options are there.
